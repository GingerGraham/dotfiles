# Shell configuration

## Overview

Shell config lives at `~/.config/shell/` — an XDG-compliant directory that is a symlink back into the dotfiles repo. Editing any file there takes effect in the next shell session with no Ansible re-run required.

Both `~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc` are thin stubs that do one thing: source `~/.config/shell/loader.sh`. All logic lives there.

## Loading order

`loader.sh` runs once per shell startup in this sequence:

1. Source `bash-logger` (structured logging available to everything downstream)
2. Detect OS → `$DOTFILES_OS` (`Linux` / `Mac`)
3. Detect WSL → `$DOTFILES_WSL` (`true` / `false`)
4. Detect distro → `$DOTFILES_DISTRO` (`rhel` / `debian` / `suse` / `arch` / `unknown`)
5. Detect shell → `$DOTFILES_SHELL` (`bash` / `zsh` / `sh`)
6. Source `env/` files in numeric order
7. Source `core/` unconditionally
8. Source each `tools/` file if its guard passes (`command -v <tool>`)
9. Source `platform/$DOTFILES_OS.sh`; additionally source `platform/wsl.sh` if `$DOTFILES_WSL == "true"`
10. Source `distro/$DOTFILES_DISTRO.sh`
11. Source completions with the same tool guards
12. Elect a prompt engine (oh-my-posh → oh-my-zsh → distro-native → fallback PS1)
13. Register lazy stubs for `lazy/`
14. Source `env/90-local.sh` last — machine-local overrides win

Detection runs exactly once per session. Results are exported as `DOTFILES_*` variables; no repeated `uname` or `/etc/os-release` reads.

## Three loading tiers

### Tier 1 — Eager, always

`env/` and `core/` load unconditionally on every shell start. Files here must be fast — no subprocesses, no network calls.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `env/00-core.sh` | XDG paths, base PATH extensions, locale, history |
| `env/10-editors.sh` | `EDITOR`, `VISUAL`, pager |
| `env/20-development.sh` | `GOPATH`, `PYENV_ROOT`, language version manager hooks |
| `env/90-local.sh` | Machine-local overrides — created once, never overwritten |
| `core/aliases.sh` | Navigation aliases (`ls`, `cd`, common shortcuts) |
| `core/functions.sh` | Shell introspection (`get-my-functions`, `dedupe-path`) |
| `core/ssh.sh` | SSH agent helpers, `list-ssh-hosts` |

### Tier 2 — Conditional eager

`tools/`, `platform/`, and `distro/` files load only when the relevant condition is true. Each `tools/` file guards itself at the top with `command -v <tool> &>/dev/null || return 0`.

Available tool files: `git.sh`, `kubernetes.sh`, `terraform.sh`, `ansible.sh`, `containers.sh`, `aws.sh`, `azure.sh`, `security.sh`, `go.sh`.

Platform and distro files add platform-specific aliases, PATH entries, and environment setup. `platform/wsl.sh` is sourced **in addition to** `platform/linux.sh` on WSL systems (not instead of it).

### Tier 3 — Lazy

`lazy/` files are never sourced at startup. Instead, stub functions are registered automatically at startup by scanning each `lazy/*.sh` file for public function definitions. The stub sources the file and replays the original call on first use; subsequent calls go directly to the real function.

```bash
# install-zsh is available immediately after shell start,
# but lazy/installers.sh is not sourced until you actually call it.
install-zsh
```

Use `get-my-installers` (alias: `installers`) to list all available lazy install commands.

## Prompt engine selection

`loader.sh` elects a prompt engine in priority order:

1. **oh-my-posh** — if `oh-my-posh` is in `$PATH`
2. **oh-my-zsh** — if `~/.oh-my-zsh` exists and the shell is zsh
3. **distro-native** — if the distro file exports `_DOTFILES_DISTRO_PROMPT_FILE` pointing to a valid file (zsh only)
4. **Fallback PS1** — set unconditionally if none of the above match; detects terminal colour support and sets an appropriate `PS1`

## Exported variables

| Variable | Values | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| `DOTFILES_OS` | `Linux` / `Mac` | `loader.sh` |
| `DOTFILES_WSL` | `true` / `false` | `loader.sh` |
| `DOTFILES_DISTRO` | `rhel` / `debian` / `suse` / `arch` / `unknown` | `loader.sh` |
| `DOTFILES_SHELL` | `bash` / `zsh` / `sh` | `loader.sh` |
| `DOTFILES_SHOW_FUNCTIONS` | `true` / `false` (default: `false`) | `env/90-local.sh` |
| `SHELL_CONFIG_DIR` | `~/.config/shell` | `loader.sh` |
| `DOTFILES_REPO_DIR` | path to repo | `env/00-core.sh` |

## Machine-local overrides

`~/.config/shell/env/90-local.sh` is the place for anything specific to one machine:

- Additional PATH entries
- Proxy settings
- Credential exports
- Tool version pins

It is created from a template on the first Ansible run and **never overwritten** by subsequent runs. It is gitignored, so it will not appear in commits. Edit it directly on the machine.

Set `DOTFILES_SHOW_FUNCTIONS=true` here to print the function list automatically on every interactive shell start.

## Shell introspection

Two functions are available in every shell:

```bash
get-my-functions    # Lists all loaded functions and aliases
get-my-installers   # Lists lazy install-* commands (alias: installers)
```

`get-my-functions` excludes functions prefixed with `_` (private helpers) and functions prefixed with `install-` (those are shown by `get-my-installers` instead).

## Migration from an existing shell config

If `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.zshenv` exists as a real file (not already a symlink) when `install.sh` runs, the shell role backs it up:

```
~/.config/dotfiles/migration/<filename>.pre-dotfiles.bak
```

A warning is printed on every shell start until the backup directory is cleared:

```
[WARN]  Migration pending: review backup files and merge any needed content
        into env/90-local.sh, then remove ~/.config/dotfiles/migration/ to
        clear this warning.
```

After porting any content you want to keep into `env/90-local.sh`:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/dotfiles/migration/
```
